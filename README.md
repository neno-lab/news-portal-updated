This is News Portal App which is made by Typescript, Node.js/Express, React, Redux and SCSS. This app has its own "home page" where all articles are grouped by categories. You have option to choose your category you want at dropdown menu. Each category is clickable and it leads to its own "article page". Moreover, there is a search filter for the article list and possibility for bookmarking your favorite article from the 'home page'. Each article has option to remove from the list of favorites, too. However, the app is not 100% finished beacuse it still gives me an error when you try to press back to "localhost:3000". I will try to figure it out why :). You have to do it manually for now. Finally, I have been using SCSS to style components rather than SASS because I found it more readable in code.

/* SCRIPTS */
- app start (server + client): npm run dev
- only server: npm run server
- only client (you have to be in "client" folder): npm start
